<h3>Five Element Acupuncture: who is it for?</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/M-MOXAONHAND.jpg" alt="" /></span>Acupuncture is a spiritual tradition and an empowering system of preventative Chinese medicine that dates back thousands of years. It addresses the needs of people at the level of the body, mind and spirit.
It is one of the safest medical practices on offer in the UK today and is used by thousands of people as an effective way of improving their health.
							</br> It facilitates self-healing through the understanding that our natural state is that of balance: we have within us the capacity to <i>sleep easily</i> and feel rested, to eat and then <i>digest</i> that food well, to grieve and then  <i>move on</i>, to <i>open ourselves</i> up to others and not lose ourselves, to <i>stand our ground</i> without biting someone's head off! 
							</br>We'll do this by acknowledging that Nature follows five "movements", which are mirrored in the seasons (and in you!): Spring, Summer, Harvest, Autumn and Winter. These are also known as the <b>Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal</b> and <b>Water</b> elements. 
							</br>When the system goes out of balance, all sorts of diseases will come up: my job as your acupuncturist is to find out the root cause of your malaise, and then support you back to your full potential, so that you can live your best, fullest, most harmonious life, restoring health across the board.
							</br>This is why acupuncture can treat a wide range of ailments: on a <b>physical</b> level, it can help with chronic conditions such as Crohn's disease, IBS, arthritis, migraines - as well as fertility issues, hormonal imbalances, insomnia and “unexplained illnesses”.
On a <b>mental</b> level it has been proven to be highly beneficial for individuals who suffer from depression, anxiety, stress, burnout, grief. 
On a <b>spiritual</b> level, it supports people who feel stuck in their lives, disconnected, who are going through a period of transition or who feel lost in their purpose. 
</p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/M-HANDSCLOSEUP.jpg" alt="" /></span>Each element is a powerful ally: 
							</br><b><span style="color:#B4B69B;">Wood</span></b> governs growth, direction and purpose. It gives us vision, drive, creativity and the ability to assert boundaries. When it’s in balance, we feel purposeful, assertive, and adaptable. When it’s out of balance, Wood can manifest as frustration, resentment, or rigidity.
</br><b><span style="color:#DD4F1F;">Fire</span></b> relates to joy, love and emotional warmth. It governs communication, intimacy, and spontaneity. In balance, Fire brings laughter, connection, and a light spirit. Out of balance it may show up as restlessness, anxiety, or emotional withdrawal.
</br><b><span style="color:#FFBD59;">Earth</span></b> represents stability, nourishment and support. It gives us the ability to care for others and ourselves. A balanced Earth brings empathy, reliability and groundedness. An imbalance might lead to anxiety, over-caretaking, or feeling depleted.
</br><b><span style="color:#231F20;">Metal</span></b> is the element of letting go and honouring what is sacred. When balanced, it offers connection, self-respect and appreciation for beauty. When imbalanced, it may show as grief, punitive perfectionism, or emotional numbness.
</br><b><span style="color:#3D668D;">Water</span></b> represents wisdom, willpower, and rest. It is the source of resilience and introspection. When our Water is flowing well, we feel calm, courageous, and connected to our inner depth. When it’s blocked, it can show as paralyzing fear or burnout.
</br></br> So it’s worth asking yourself which resonates the most: 
<b><span style="color:#B4B69B;">Do you feel stuck or blocked in some areas of your life? Do you avoid - or escalate conflict?</span> <span style="color:#DD4F1F;">Do you find it easy to connect with others authentically? Do you feel overly sensitive or emotionally detached? </span><span style="color:#FFBD59;">Do you often put others’ needs before your own? Do you overthink or obsess over small things?</span> <span style="color:#231F20;"> Are you holding onto something you need to release? Are you overly critical of yourself or others?</span> <span style="color:#3D668D;">Do you constantly feel tired - or wired? Do you trust yourself to handle the unknown?</span></b>
