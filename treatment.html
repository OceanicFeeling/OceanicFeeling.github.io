<h3>Five Element Acupuncture: who is it for?</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/M-MOXAONHAND.jpg" alt="" /></span>Five-Elements Acupuncture is a holistic healing art rooted in Daoist philosophy. The principles of interconnectedness of mind, body and spirit, and the importance of natural rhythms, are cardinal elements of this system of medicine. By correcting blockages or imbalances in the flow of Qi (our vital energy), Five-Elements Acupuncture aims to address the root cause of disease and promote healing, working with the body’s inherent ability to heal and maintain health. 
							</br>The focus is always to treat the whole person, rather than the illness they may be presenting with at any one moment in time. That being said, these are some of the most common symptoms people have come looking for treatment:</br>

- <b>Digestive issues</b> (IBS, Crohn’s disease, eating disorders, constipation)</br>
- <b>Physical tension</b> (migraines, headaches, clenched jaw, stiff back or joints)</br>
- <b>Fertility issues</b> (hormonal imbalances, endometriosis, IVF support)</br>
- <b>Stress</b> (from burnout, grief, anxiety, panic attacks)</br>
- <b>Skin conditions</b> (acne, psoriasis, eczema)</br>
- <b>Sleep problems</b> (insomnia, exhaustion, chronic fatigue)</br>
It is also being used to help with long COVID, addiction, low libido, and by those looking for support during a period of transition in life or those who feel lost in their purpose and need a "vitality tune-up"!</br>
</br>
The “Five-Element” nomenclature refers to the  five movements of Nature, which are mirrored in the seasons, and in you, and in every living thing: <b><span style="color:#B4B69B;">Wood</span></b>, <b><span style="color:#DD4F1F;">Fire</span></b>, <b><span style="color:#FFBD59;">Earth</span></b>, <span style="color:#231F20;">Metal</span></b> and <b><span style="color:#3D668D;">Water</span></b>!
</p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/M-HANDSCLOSEUP.jpg" alt="" /></span><b><span style="color:#B4B69B;">Wood</span></b> governs growth, direction and purpose. It gives us vision, drive, creativity and the ability to assert boundaries. When it’s in balance, we feel purposeful, assertive, and adaptable. When it’s out of balance, Wood can manifest as frustration, resentment, or rigidity.
</br><b><span style="color:#DD4F1F;">Fire</span></b> relates to joy, love and emotional warmth. It governs communication, intimacy, and spontaneity. In balance, Fire brings laughter, connection, and a light spirit. Out of balance it may show up as restlessness, anxiety, or emotional withdrawal.
</br><b><span style="color:#FFBD59;">Earth</span></b> represents stability, nourishment and support. It gives us the ability to care for others and ourselves. A balanced Earth brings empathy, reliability and groundedness. An imbalance might lead to anxiety, over-caretaking, or feeling depleted.
</br><b><span style="color:#231F20;">Metal</span></b> is the element of letting go and honouring what is sacred. When balanced, it offers connection, self-respect and appreciation for beauty. When imbalanced, it may show as grief, punitive perfectionism, or emotional numbness.
</br><b><span style="color:#3D668D;">Water</span></b> represents wisdom, willpower, and rest. It is the source of resilience and introspection. When our Water is flowing well, we feel calm, courageous, and connected to our inner depth. When it’s blocked, it can show as paralyzing fear or burnout.
</br></br> So it’s worth asking yourself which resonates the most: 
<b><span style="color:#B4B69B;">Do you feel stuck or blocked in some areas of your life? Do you avoid - or escalate conflict?</span></br> 
	<span style="color:#DD4F1F;">Do you find it easy to connect with others authentically? Do you feel overly sensitive, or emotionally detached? </span></br>
	<span style="color:#FFBD59;">Do you often put others’ needs before your own? Do you overthink or obsess over small things?</span> </br>
	<span style="color:#231F20;"> Are you holding onto something you need to release? Are you overly critical of yourself or others?</span>
</br> <span style="color:#3D668D;">Do you constantly feel tired - or wired? Do you trust yourself to handle the unknown?</span></b>
