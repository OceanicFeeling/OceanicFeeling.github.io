<button class="accordion"><span style="color:#eff0e9;">What is acupuncture?</span></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Acupuncture is an empowering system of preventative Chinese medicine that dates back thousands of years. It addresses the needs of people at the level of the body, mind and spirit.
It is one of the safest medical practices on offer in the UK today and is used by thousands of people as an effective way of improving their health.
Five Element Acupuncture is its most classical practice, and it is a spiritual tradition that aims to treat the whole person rather than simply managing their symptoms. It does so by acknowledging that us human beings are one with Nature, and as such are governed by the same natural laws. When the system goes out of balance, all sorts of diseases will come up: this is where the Acupuncturist intervenes, by finding the root cause of the imbalance and restoring health across the board.
</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Who has acupuncture?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Acupuncture can treat a wide range of ailments. 
On a physical level, it can help with chronic conditions such as Crohn's disease, IBS, arthritis, migraines - as well as fertility issues, hormonal imbalances, insomnia and “unexplained illnesses”.
On a mental level it has been proven to be highly beneficial for individuals who suffer from depression, anxiety, stress, burnout, grief. 
On a spiritual level, it supports people who feel stuck in their lives, disconnected, who are going through a period of transition or who feel lost in their purpose. 
</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Is it safe?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Yes, when practiced by a licensed, trained professional. I am a member of the British Acupuncture Foundation under the Association of Five Element Acupuncture and am fully insured to practice. I only ever use sterile, single-use needles which are then disposed of safely immediately after use. 
The most common side effect is some light bruising (3 in 100 treatments) which will go away in the space of a couple of days. 
This practice is also safe for pregnant people, people with pacemakers and people who have been diagnosed with cancer: I will, however, need to know about these conditions and will require a list of the medication you’re on. This will all be covered in our initial consultation. 
</p>
</div>

	<button class="accordion">What happens at the appointment?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>During our first treatment, we’ll go through your medical history, lifestyle and desired results from treatment, so that I can get as clear a picture as possible of who you are and how I can best tailor the treatment to your needs. I will then insert some very fine, sterile single-use needles in the acupuncture points to promote the movement of energy through the body. Other than in very few cases, these needles will only stay in a few seconds and then be removed. We will also make use of a herb called moxa, which is placed directly on the skin to warm up the point ahead of the needle insertion.
It is recommended to wear loose clothing during the treatment, and in the first session I always suggest that the patient doesn’t wear make-up, perfumes, or bras that don’t unhook - as I’ll need access to your back.
</p>
</div>

	<button class="accordion">What does it feel like?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>When the needle is inserted you might feel a slight piercing sensation.
Not all patients feel the needle being inserted. 
Once the needle makes contact with the acupuncture point, what we are looking for is a dull ache, or a warm feeling, which will indicate that we have established contact with the energy in your body: as soon as this happens, the needle is manipulated in a quick movement to tonify the point and immediately removed. On the rare occasions the needles are left in the skin, you won’t feel any pain at all, and will actually probably experience a very calming effect over your body.
</p>
</div>

	<button class="accordion">Does it work? </button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Yes! There is an ever-growing body of research showing that acupuncture does work. Acupuncture is listed as a form of Complementary or Alternative Medicine on the NHS, marked as safe and even included in the training of many of their physiotherapists. It is a practice offered in many of their hospitals to support people through difficult diagnosis, and it is recommended by the NIHCE for all sorts of chronic pains, including headaches and prostatitis. It is also recommended by Macmillan as a form of supporting therapy for those undergoing cancer treatment. 
Acupuncture is also the most commonly used adjunctive therapy to IVF with many clinics recommending it alongside treatment: a 2018 HFEA report said acupuncture is used in over a quarter of all IVF cycles. 
</p>
</div>

	<button class="accordion">How many treatments will I need?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Initially, it is recommended that patients come weekly for about 4 or 5 sessions, then fortnightly and progressing to monthly or even seasonally. This will be discussed with you as we progress with treatment, as each patient will have requirements for a uniquely tailored care. </p>
</div>

	<button class="accordion">Can I book an appointment for my child?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Unfortunately at this stage I only treat people over 18. If you have an 18+ year old child that would benefit from treatment, you are more than welcome to recommend this style of healing to them, but they will need to be booking it for themselves and what transpires throughout the sessions will remain strictly confidential.</p>
</div>

	<button class="accordion">What’s the accessibility of your clinic like?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Accessibility is important to me, and I want to make sure your visit feels safe and comfortable. I currently work from the Elements Project clinic in Shoreditch, on the second floor of a building with no lifts. There is a standard toilet on the third floor, and banisters alongside the flights of stairs.  If you have any access needs — physical, sensory, or communication-related — please feel free to get in touch. I’ll do my best to accommodate your needs.
